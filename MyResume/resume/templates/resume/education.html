                    <p class="">
                        In this course,
                         I focused on the practical aspects,
                          which I found enjoyable.
                           We worked on various projects,
                            implementing algorithms and models to solve real-world problems.
                            I learned about supervised and unsupervised learning,
                             as well as techniques such as support vector machines,
                              neural networks,
                               and ensemble methods.
                                The course covered gradient descent,
                                 cluster analysis,
                                  and dimensionality reduction.
                                   Additionally,
                                    I explored essential skills in feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning through various hands-on projects.

                    <p class="">
                        This course covered the main concepts, 
                         tools, and techniques related to software testing.
                          I learned about the importance of software validation and verification,
                           as well as how to develop test plans,
                            test scripts,
                             and test cases.
                            We focused on black-box and white-box testing techniques including various types of testing such as unit,
                               and functional testing.
                                  We explored techniques like equivalence partitioning and path testing,
                                   and examined integration and system testing.
                                      The course emphasized testing within an Agile development environment.

                    <p class="">
                        I took a course on information retrieval methods,
                         learning how to improve searches for specific items on a website,
                          related to LLMs. We explored different algorithms for indexing and searching,
                           and I conducted experiments to analyze the effectiveness of various retrieval techniques.
                            This course not only provided a theoretical foundation but also practical skills in optimizing search engines and understanding user behavior.
